When it comes to looking at how the frontend of your site is performing, there are two main tools to use: **Synthetic Monitoring** and **Real User Monitoring**. Synthetic Monitoring uses bots scattered around the world to hit your frontend endpoints. Real User Monitoring adds a little snippet of Javascript to your site that tracks performance metrics for actual visits by regular human visitors. In this Hands On section we will look at Synthetic Monitoring and we will cover Real User Monitoring, or RUM, in the next section.
