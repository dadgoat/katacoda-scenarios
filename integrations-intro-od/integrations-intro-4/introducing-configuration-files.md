There are a number of configuration files and formats. The most obvious is `config.yaml`, which is used to configure the integration itself. If you've ever configured a Datadog Agent integration in the past, you've likely encountered such a file. Beyond that, there exists an assortment of files that serve other purposes within the larger Datadog ecosystem.

All of the files need to be present and populated in order for the integration to be accepted "upstream" in the Datadog integrations-extras (or marketplace) repository, so it's important to be aware of these files. The [Introduction to Integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/integrations/) section in the official Datadog documentation is an excellent resource for more details.

When you're ready, move onto the next step to look at your first file.
