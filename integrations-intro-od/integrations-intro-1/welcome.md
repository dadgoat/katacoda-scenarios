Welcome to the Intro to Datadog Integrations course! The interface you see in your browser right now is what you'll use to install and configure software, write code, and have some fun learning about Linux, Python, and Datadog. There are three panels:
1. This panel, which is where text content, instructions, and challenges are presented.
2. The panel in the upper right, which is a combination file explorer and text editor.
3. The panel in the lower right, which is a terminal on a real live Linux system. Do _not_ close or exit this terminal.

The file explorer can be used to navigate the file system, create files and folders, and open files for editing. Try:
- Right-click on `/root`, then navigate through New ▶ File.
- Name the file `hello_world`.
- Click on `hello_world` to open the file in the editor (feel free to type something).
- Close the file by clicking on the little `x` in the tab above the editor panel.
  - Note that there is no "save" button - the editor autosaves frequently.

Files can also be opened in the editor via special links, for example: `hello_world`{{open}}.

When this course was loaded, a small series of initialization actions (generally referred to as "init") kicked off. The init will be complete when you see `Provisioning Complete` and some Datadog account credentials. You won't be needing those until the last module of this course.

Note that one of the things done during init is setting the version of Python to 3.x, which is required by the tooling.

Oh, one last thing: whenever you see some `fixed-width text` with a ⏎ following it, that means you can click on the text to execute that command in the terminal. For example: `echo "Hello, World!"`{{execute}}

And while this has already been said, it's very important: do _not_ close or exit from the terminal. You'll have to start all over again if you do.

Your first challenges:
- Run a command directly in the terminal (try `echo "hi"`).
- Move on to the next step.
