With all of that out of the way, the last step is to actually visualise the results of the check. Load up the Datadog web interface and navigate to Dashboards ‚Üí New Dashboard, then set up a *screenboard* with a [Check Status widget](https://docs.datadoghq.com/graphing/widgets/check_status/#pagetitle) based on the `awesome.search` check.

And with that: congratulations! You just went from zero to a dashboard powered by a functioning integration. Well done! Now's a good time for cake. üç∞
