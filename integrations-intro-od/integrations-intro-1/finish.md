If you're hungry for more (Datadog, that is), there's no reason to stop here. Remember all those documentation pages
 we bookmarked along the way? Everything you need to take your integrations to the next level is there. Your best bet is
 to start at [the beginning](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/), and if you need help, don't hesitate to attend our
 [Community Office Hours](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/office_hours/), held twice monthly.

Thanks for playing!
