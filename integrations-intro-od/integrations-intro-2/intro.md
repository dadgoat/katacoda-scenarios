The previous lab focused on setting up the environment to work on a Datadog integration. When this lab starts, a script runs to configure the environment in the same way as described in that lab.

Now you're going to make a Check class (and discover what that means) for the integration and write a unit test for it.

When you're ready, click "Start Scenario" to get started!
