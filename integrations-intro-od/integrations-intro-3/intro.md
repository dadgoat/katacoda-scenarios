The previous lab focused on building a check and corresponding unit test. When this scenario starts, a script runs to match the state of your environment at the end of that lab.

Now that you have an integration and a unit test, the next step is to create an integration test  ("integration" here in the sense of testing the software as a whole, not in the sense of a "Datadog integration").

Your unit test made sure that the integration properly handled the different configuration cases, but didn’t actually check functionality of the integration itself. That is what you will be doing with the integration test.

When you're ready, get started!
