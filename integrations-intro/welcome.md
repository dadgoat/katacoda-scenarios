Welcome to the Intro to Datadog Integrations course! The interface you see in your browser right now is what we'll use to install and configure software, write code, and have some fun learning about Linux, Python, and Datadog. There are three panels:
1. This panel, which is where text content, instructions, and challenges are presented.
1. The panel in the upper-right, which is a combination file explorer and text editor.
1. The panel in the lower-right, which is a terminal on a real live Linux system.

Try clicking on the `.profile` file in the file explorer. It will open that file in the editor. Any changes you make in the editor are applied immediately—in other words, there's no save button. The file can be closed by clicking that little `x` in the tab above the editor pane.

When this course was loaded, a small series of initialisation actions (generally referred to as "init") kicked off. The init will be complete when you see `You're good to go!`. Oh, one last thing: whenever you see some `fixed-width text` with a ⏎ following it, that means you can click on the text to execute that command in the terminal. For example: `echo "Hello, World!"`{{execute}}

Your first challenges:
- Open and close a file via the explorer.
- Run a command by clicking on it.
- Move on to the next step.
