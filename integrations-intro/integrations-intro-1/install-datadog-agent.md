The first thing we're going to do is [install the Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent). There are installation instructions for a variety of environments, so which one do we choose? Let's find out: try running `lsb_release -a`{{execute}}. (And, yes, that's already a hint as to our current operating environment).

Now we know! Install the Agent by copying and pasting the "[easy one-step install](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/ubuntu)" one-liner into the console. It won't take long.

So why install the Agent nowâ€”before we've even started coding? This way, when we're ready to test things later on, our little virtual machine will have been reporting data for a while, which will make it more interesting by the time we get to the end of this course. ðŸ˜€

Once you've got a prompt again, be sure to verify that the Agent is running before continuing: `systemctl status datadog-agent`{{execute}}.
