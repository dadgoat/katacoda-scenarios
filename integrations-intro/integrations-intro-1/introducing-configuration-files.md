There are a number of configuration files and formats. The most obvious is `config.yaml`, which is used to configure the integration itself. If you've ever configured a Datadog Agent integration in the past, you've likely encountered such a file. Beyond that, there exists a motley assortment of files that serve other purposes within the larger Datadog ecosystemâ€”and don't worry if YAML isn't your thing, because we'll be looking at JSON and CSV files too! ðŸ˜‰

All of the files need to be present and populated in order for the integration to be accepted "upstream", which is to say, in the Datadog integrations-extras repository, so it's important to be aware of these files. The [Introduction to Integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/integrations/) section in the official Datadog documentation is an excellent resource, so feel free to open and bookmark that page right now.

With that now said, let's move along!
