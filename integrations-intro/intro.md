Welcome to the Introduction to Datadog Integrations course!

This course is based on the [official integrations documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/integrations/new_check_howto/) and is meant to act as a fun and interactive way to get started with Datadog integrations.

This course is self-contained, so you don't need to worry about your local machine or existing development environment. The only pre-requisite is a Datadog account. Sign up for a [free 14-day trial](https://app.datadoghq.com/signup) even if you're an existing customer, so that you can play and learn without worrying about production data. Go ahead—I'll wait…

Got that account set up? Great! Click on that big Start Scenario button to get started.
