As time moves on and incidents come and go, it is important to be able to check the history of your incident response process. Is the process efficent? Is the workload distributed fairly? Where can things be improved? To answer these questions, you're going to need aggregated statistics that can tell a story about how your incident response process is fairing over time.

Datadog provides you with a queryable Incident Management Analytics data source, so you can leverage the Dashboard and Notebook widgets you're familiar with to create incident reports, landing pages, and more! In order to help you get started, Datadog also provides a [Dashboard template](https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/integration/30523/incident-management-overview?from_ts=1634171657095&to_ts=1634776457095&live=true) and [Notebook template](https://app.datadoghq.com/notebook/template/11/incident-management-overview) for helping you get started. You can clone either of these templates and customize the clones as necessary.

Let's head to the Dashboard template, [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/integration/30523/incident-management-overview?from_ts=1634171657095&to_ts=1634776457095&live=true)

To explore the queries in this Dashboard and customize them, we first need to clone the Dashboard to make our own editable copy. To do so click the `Clone Dashboard` button at the top of the page next to the title of the Dashboard.

Give your cloned Dashboard the title: `[your initials] Workshop Analytics`{{copy}}

Take a minute to explore the Dashboard and try to edit any of the widgets to see what the different queries look like.
