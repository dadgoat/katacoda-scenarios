You should already be signed into the [Slack workspace](https://2021-im-workshop.slack.com/) for this workshop. If you are not or did not receive an invite, please let a TA know.

The Slack integration is already installed for the Datadog organization, but additional steps are needed to connect _your_ Datadog/Slack identity.

Within Slack, type the `/datadog` command in any channel to see the available Datadog Slack commands. This will post a message only you can see that gives an overview of the Slash commands available in the Datadog Slack App. Since you haven't connected your Datadog account yet, you'll also notice at the top a prompt to "Connect Datadog Account":

Click this and follow the prompts to generate an application key (**note:** make sure you are in the _Workshop Incident Management_ Datadog Organization from Step 2):

And sign in with Slack:

Your account should now be connected. Please ask a TA for help if you have any problems.
