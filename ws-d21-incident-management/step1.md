For this workshop, the data flowing into Datadog will come from a single environment, controlled by the workshop instructor. You have your own copy of this environment here so that you can easily inspect code and be granted your own Datadog login credentials. Once the environment is established, you will see the credentials displayed for you.

In a new window/tab, log in to the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login" target="_datadog">Datadog account</a> that was created for you by the lab. If you need to recall your credentials, type `creds`{{execute}} in the terminal.

Please do not continue to the next exercise until directed to do so by the workshop instructor.
