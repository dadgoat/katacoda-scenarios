1. After a browsing Storedog and waiting a few seconds, you should see "Data is reporting successfully!" in the Datadog UI. (If you closed the page for your RUM application, you can open it again from the [RUM Application List](https://app.datadoghq.com/rum/list))
2. If you click on the **Explore User Sessions** button, you'll start to see some of the data that is made available through RUM.
3. Along the top of the graph, you can click and explore the types of data that RUM makes accessible to you:
  1. **Session** groups interactions by user session and includes information about session duration, pages visited, interactions, resources loaded, errors, etc. By clicking on a row here, you can also look at the attributes tab to determine the user IP, browser, and other information.
  2. **Views** shows you what pages users are visiting. Clicking on a row here provides more detail on the view including page load speeds and resources used.
  3. **Actions** lists actions taken by a user such as clicks and any custom actions you've defined with the [`addUserAction` API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/browser/advanced_configuration/?tab=npm#custom-user-actions)
  4. **Errors** provides a list of errors experienced on the user side.
  5. **Resources** provides a list of all resources served to users.
  6. **Long Tasks** provides a listing of any task in a browser that blocks the main thread for more than 50ms.
